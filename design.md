# Art & Design for 1418

# Fonts
* ADAM CG PRO font is to be used for ALL header/large text. This includes text on tee shirts, websites, etc. [You can download ADAM here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/13756975/ADAMCG-PRO-Free-Typeface).
* [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), preferably light weight, must be used for all paragraph text and similar.

# Colors
The team colors are red, black, and white. Here are some specifics you should follow when designing team material:
* For the red colors, use `#d12727`.
* Avoid full black. Instead, use a very dark grey such as `#333333` (best shortened to `#333` when writing code).
* Use full white for white colors.
