### Section 1: Introduction to Robotics
__1.1 What is FIRST?__

FIRST was started in 1989 by renowned inventor Dean Kamen. The FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) programs aim to create passion for science and technology in students. The FIRST program encourages Gracious Professionalism and Co-Opertition, sportsmanship amongst teams even in the face of competition. Through FIRST, students build technical skills, and foster teamwork and leadership skills.
[Additional Things to Mention]
1. FIRST’s four divisions
2. (Briefly) Vae Victis’ involvement in helping other FRC/FTC/FLL/Jr.FLL teams
3. Process of how a robot is built in within FIRST’s requirements
4. (Briefly) Explain previous challenge
5. Mention the team’s website and/or social media
6. Direct to first website as well

4. List of mentors (for FTC and FRC [possibly FLL too])

FRC Mentors play a vital role in the success of their students. Mentors work extensively with team members during the build season, designing, building, and fabricating a functional robot for Competition. Their expertise is the catalyst for the team’s and students’ success. FRC Mentors are the major distinction between the FRC program and other robotic competitions as they act as a professional role model for the students.
Mentors engage and inspire students in ways far beyond science and technology. They enable both students and adults to appreciate the value of sportsmanship, teamwork, and Gracious Professionalism®.
